# Research Project Database
Please see our paper for the intial information and discussion of the research project database. Our efforts to develop an open source DER dataset extend to analyzing the design of future decarbonized energy systems and sharing results broadly with the energy community. Further, we make a call to action for the energy community to collaborate on enhancing the DER dataset, further developing the modeling and simulation capabilities of the integrated test system and platform, and sharing simulation code and insights around how to reach decarbonization goals. The Research Project Database is a key part of this initiative. It poses a series of questions focused on DERs and decarbonization. This database will be updated with results and analysis, as well as new questions to be considered by the research community. If you have contributions to this database, please reach out!


## Impact of DERs on the transmission grid

* Are transmission constraints such as congestion limits impacted with high DER penetration? 
* In particular, what is the impact of DERs on storage operation when accounting for grid limits and power flows?
* Can DERs serve as an NWA in place of transmission expansion? 
* What composition of DERs would reduce the need for transmission expansion (ex. PV, EVs, storage)? 
* What penetration of DERs would eliminate the need for new transmission corridors across state lines or service territories? 
* Can DERs increase the hosting capacity of renewable generation in the US grid? How is hosting capacity defined for the transmission system, distribution system, and for different resources? 
* What are the main challenges to increasing the installed capacity of renewables (ex. transmission capacity), and can DERs provide support? What composition of DERs is needed? 
* Under different rates of DER adoption, what system upgrades need to be made to accommodate these devices? Do the penetration levels vary for different resource types? 
* Can effective DER integration strategies increase grid resilience and system security of the Western interconnect, with a particular focus on wildfire threats in the California region? 
* Can DER flexibility reduce power flow across transmission lines in key locations with high wildfire threat?

## Impact of DERs on the transmission resources
At current and projected penetration levels, what impacts do DERs have on transmission resources? 
* Are bulk system generators operated differently in regions with high DER penetration? 
* As the U.S. grid evolves and high penetration of DERs are integrated into the grid, are there non-fossil resources which become stranded investments?

## Value of DERs
What is the economic value of DERs in a rapidly changing electricity grid?
* What are the key grid services needed to ensure rate of return on DER investment? Do these grid services vary between the transmission and distribution grids?
* What is the optimal value stacking portfolio for DERs participating in providing new grid services? 
* Do current policies support the optimal value stacking?

## Supporting interconnection and integration of DERs
From a [Macro Grid](https://science.breakthroughenergy.org/key-findings/macro-grid) perspective, substantial DER investment may not be the cost effective choice, as compared to a cross-state collaborative policy strategy to reach carbon emissions goals for 2030 \cite{Macrogrid_BES_2021}. However, given the rapid proliferation of DERs, it is undeniable that they will play a key role in electricity decarbonization. To this end, what interconnection policies are needed to support effective decarbonization pathways with DERs?
* What is the impact of different integration policies and mechanisms on DER investment decisions? 
* Based on the value stacking optimization for DERs, is there a break-even point for DER investments at the macro-grid scale (as compared to other investment decisions) after which DERs become the low-cost option?
* Are current integration policies ``future-proof'', i.e. will they continue to be viable under projections for different DER adoption rates, emergence of new technologies, or changes in adoption trends?

## Evolution of electricity market
How does the growth of DERs drive change in electricity market design, beyond U.S. FERC Order 2222\footnote{This project category focuses on the U.S. market structure, to reflect the geographic boundaries of the dataset. However, similar questions can be posed for other electricity systems, such as those with evolving market structures in Europe and Asia.}?
* Do DERs impact the locational marginal price (LMP) of electricity \cite{Wilkinson_DPV_impact_LMP}? 
* Is the impact of DERs on electricity prices sensitive to market participation models, composition of DERs, and DER integration at the distribution level?
* At what penetration level and market participation levels do DERs impact the wholesale LMP or retail prices? 
* Note: The analysis in this project domain should consider different participation models, such as DER aggregations participating directly in the wholesale market as proposed by FERC Order 2222 \cite{ferc2222}, local retail electricity markets \cite{Haider_ADAPEN}, and different transmission-distribution price coordination mechanisms. 

## Sustainability beyond electricity generation
The growth of new renewable generation installations will eventually produce large amounts of waste at the end-of-life of devices including PV cells, wind turbines, and batteries. Sustainability in manufacturing, waste management, and material reuse are essential towards achieving a truly carbon-free future U.S. grid, necessitating a cradle-to-cradle perspective on lifecycle analysis.
* What are optimal locations for waste collection centers and recycling facilities given the DER distribution of the present U.S. grid? 
* Which states should focus on early deployment of repurposed batteries, recycling technologies, and collection facilities? A market analysis should consider at a minimum the density of EVs and grid storage and the value of storage to the grid and resource owners. 
* Are state and federal incentives for EV adoption aligned with incentives for home and community storage, particularly for using depleted EV batteries for grid storage? 
* Does the cradle-to-cradle perspective provide an opportunity to support low-income communities with lower cost repurposed EV batteries?
* Note: The analysis above should consider different use cases of grid storage, including improving grid resiliency during weather events (ex. heat waves, wildfires, natural disasters), achieving 24/7 100\% renewable energy, and reducing electricity costs (towards reducing energy poverty rates).
